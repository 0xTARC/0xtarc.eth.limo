## Crypto Wallet UX Sucks
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fbd41e62b-4cf0-41fe-8010-875b48d24c21_600x893.jpg)
It‚Äôs no mystery that interacting with blockchains is still hard compared to the buttery-slickness of today‚Äôs FinTech.

Think about the difference between buying Minecraft on the App Store with PayPal, and buying an NFT on OpenSea with MetaMask.

This is the gap we need to fill.

And the novice users aren‚Äôt the only ones struggling.

Even ‚Äúcrypto natives‚Äù struggle with things like

- sending and receiving payments
- accidentally signing malicious transactions
- managing multiple accounts
- doing multi-sig transactions in a timely manner
- needing like 27 clicks to do a simple swap
- losing keys
- AND MORE! WTF!

We can do better üôÇ

But how? First, let‚Äôs define what a wallet is. In UX-speak, what are the ‚Äúaffordances‚Äù of a wallet?

When I say ‚Äúwallet‚Äù I‚Äôm not thinking about a hunk of metal engraved with 24 magic words. I‚Äôm thinking along the lines of MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet - something you would use every day for financial transactions. In general, this wallet should let you do the following:

- Generate, securely store, and backup private keys
- Manage multiple accounts (e.g. a ‚Äúchecking account‚Äù and an ‚Äúinvestment account‚Äù)
- Share your accounts with others
- Allow you to create, cancel, and see past transactions, like sending money to a friend.

Most people use Trust Wallet or MetaMask for these abilities.

Some use hardware wallets like Ledgers, which can add even *more* complexity (worth it!).

And multi-sigs signers? Forget it. Advanced users only, and we quadruple check every step of the way.

## Tools and Ideas to Make it Better

It can be so much better. Here are some tools and ideas to improve wallet UX:

#### Tools

- 
Gnosis Safe Modules. [Zodiac](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) has a ton of great ones.

- 
Zodiac, ‚ÄúThe expansion pack for DAOs‚Äù, provides amazing extensions for your multi-sig wallets like Gnosis Safe. They provide **Modules**, like **[Exit](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-exit)** for DAOs built on Gnosis Safe to allow their members to ‚Äúrage quit‚Äù, or [Reality](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-reality) to do things like execute on-chain transactions based on the results of a Snapshot vote. There‚Äôs also **Modifiers**, which includes [Roles](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles) for roles-based access control and [Delay](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-delay) for time-delayed contract execution, and **Guards**, like [Scope](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope) for whitelisting specific contract interactions.

- 
[delegate.cash](https://delegate.cash/), allows for safe delegation of certain transactions involving cold wallet assets from a hot wallet.

- 
[MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/) and [Snaps](https://metamask.io/snaps/).

- 
MetaMask Flask is the ‚Äúcanary‚Äù build of MetaMask for developers that lets you install Snaps. Snaps are a really exciting feature that let you build and install extensions for MetaMask. Some of my favorite snaps:

- 
[Snap auto approvals](https://github.com/livingrockrises/snap-auto-approvals)

- 
Creates a ‚Äúsession‚Äù where transactions get auto-signed until the session ends. Similar to how you can sign into a bank account, do multiple transactions, then sign out. This is *amazing* for blockchain gaming.

- 
Multi-Chain snaps, allowing you to interact with non-EVM blockchains through MetaMask.

- 
[BTCSnap](https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/btcsnap), [FilSnap](https://github.com/ChainSafe/filsnap), [ArSnap](https://github.com/pianity/arsnap), [metamask-snap-polkadot](https://github.com/ChainSafe/metamask-snap-polkadot) , etc.

- 
[Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)

- 
The free human-readable usernames make sending and receiving money between friends a breeze. We shouldn‚Äôt need to keep a list of our friends‚Äô public keys. An integrated fiat on-ramp too? Nice. I recommend this one, paired with a Trezor or Ledger, to people new to crypto.

#### Some Ideas

Please build this!

- Integrate the [GasHawk](https://gashawk.io/) API into a MetaMask snap, giving you the option to schedule a transaction to be executed at a time with low gas. No extra RPC needed.
- Don‚Äôt like that MetaMask now tracks your IP? Build an ‚ÄúAdBlock‚Äù snap (lol).
- Snap that integrates with EPNS so you get alerted in MetaMask for things like a low health factor, or a friend requesting payment.
- A snap for DefiLlama‚Äôs meta-dex aggregator. Always use the superior swap, anon.
- This one is obvious but I can‚Äôt help mentioning it: how about a ‚ÄúSnap Store‚Äù? This is how Snaps are currently distributed

Clunky? Well the Snap Store aggregates all Snaps, with ratings. You can even integrate payments, allowing developers to monetize MetaMask plugins.

- A point-of-sale / on-ramp built on the [Gas Station Network](https://opengsn.org/), allowing anyone with a credit card (no gas in their wallet needed) to settle transactions on crypto rails.
- A Gnosis Safe Module for small investment clubs/farming as a service providers.
- A Gnosis Safe Module for functionality like GasHawk‚Äôs, e.g. delaying a transaction until a time where the gas price is expected to be low.
- ENS integrations like Coinbase Wallet has everywhere please.
